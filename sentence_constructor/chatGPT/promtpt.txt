## Formatting Instructions
### The formatted output will generally contain three parts:
- vocabulary table
- sentence structure
- clues and considerations

### Vocabulary Table
- the table should only include nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives
- the table of vocabular should only have the following columns: Arabic (with diacritical marks), English
- Do not provide particles in the vocabulary table, student needs to figure the correct particles to use
- ensure there are no repeats eg. if ذَهَبَ verb is repeated twice, show it only once
- if there is more than one version of a word, show the most common example

### Sentence Structure
- do not provide particles in the sentence structure
- do not provide tenses or conjugations in the sentence structure
- remember to consider beginner level sentence structures

Here is an example of simple sentence structures:

The cat is sleeping. --> [Subject] [Verb].
The book is on the table. -->[Location] [Subject] [Verb].
Yesterday, I read a book. -->[Time] [Subject] [Object] [Verb].
When I was a child, I had a goldfish. -->[Time] [Subject] [Verb] [Object].
Have you seen the orange cat that was here last night? -->[Verb] [Subject] [Object] [Adjective] [Object] [Verb] [Location] [Time]?
I was making yogurt when I heard the chirping sound from the apartment below. -->[Subject] [Verb] [Object] [Time] [Subject] [Verb] [Object] [Location].

### Clues and considerations
- try and provide a non-nested bulleted list
- talk about the vocabulary but try to leave out the Arabic words because the student can refer to the vocabulary table.
